# 🎯 EXACT STEPS TO FIX SMS - Follow This!

## 🔍 What's Wrong?

**Render server logs show:**

```
[sms:body] keys= undefined raw= undefined
```

**This means:** Render is running OLD code without the SMS fix!

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Render Dashboard (30 seconds)

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Log in if needed
3. You should see your service: **"server-cibp"**

---

### Step 2: Manual Deploy (2 minutes)

1. **Click on "server-cibp"** service
2. **Look for "Manual Deploy" button** (top right, blue button)
3. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to "Manual Deploy"
4. **Select "Clear build cache & deploy"**
5. **Wait** - You'll see:
   - "Build in progress..."
   - "Deploying..."
   - "✅ Live" (when done)

**⏱️ This takes 1-2 minutes**

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment (30 seconds)

1. **Click "Logs" tab** in Render
2. **Scroll to bottom** (latest logs)
3. **Look for these startup messages:**
   ```
   Server starting on port 3000
   ✅ [firestore] Admin SDK initialized
   ```

If you see these, deployment worked! ✅

---

### Step 4: Test SMS (1 minute)

1. **Open dashboard:** https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app/dashboard

2. **Hard refresh:**

   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Select 2 customers** (checkboxes)

4. **Click "Send 2 SMS"** button

5. **Click "Confirm"**

---

### Step 5: Check Logs (1 minute)

**Go back to Render → Logs tab**

**You should NOW see:**

```
[sms:headers] origin= https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app
[sms:content-type] application/json
[sms:manual-parse] Body is empty, attempting manual stream read...
[sms:manual-parse] Read 245 bytes from stream
[sms:manual-parse] ✅ Successfully parsed manual body
[sms:body] keys= to,body,companyId,accountSid,authToken,from
[sms:success] Message sent: SM...
```

**NOT this (old broken version):**

```
[sms:body] keys= undefined raw= undefined
```

---

## 🎉 SUCCESS INDICATORS

✅ Render logs show `[sms:manual-parse] ✅ Successfully parsed manual body`  
✅ Render logs show `[sms:body] keys= to,body,companyId,...` (not undefined)  
✅ Render logs show `[sms:success] Message sent: SM...`  
✅ Dashboard shows success alert  
✅ No 400 errors in browser console

## ❌ If Still Broken

### Problem: Render didn't deploy latest code

**Solution:**

1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Settings → Build & Deploy
3. Click "Trigger deploy" again
4. Make sure it says "Deploy from latest commit"

### Problem: Render deployed but still shows old logs

**Solution:**

1. Wait 30 seconds (Render cache)
2. Hard refresh dashboard (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Try SMS again
4. Check logs again

### Problem: GitHub won't let me push

**Solution:**
You don't need GitHub! Just deploy manually to Render (Step 2 above).

Or allow the secret:
