## 🚀 DO THIS NOW (3 Minutes Total)

### Step 1: Open Render (30 seconds)

You should see your service called **"server-cibp"** or similar.

### Step 2: Deploy (2 minutes)

1. **Click on your service name** ("server-cibp")

2. **Look for the blue "Manual Deploy" button** (top right corner)

3. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to it

4. **Select "Clear build cache & deploy"**

5. **Wait** - You'll see:
   - "Build in progress..." (~1 min)
   - "Deploying..." (~30 sec)
   - "✅ Live" (DONE!)

**Do NOT close the browser!** Wait for "✅ Live".

---

### Step 3: Test SMS (1 minute)

1. **Open your dashboard:**

   ```
   https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app/dashboard
   ```

2. **IMPORTANT: Hard refresh the page**

   - Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - This clears old cached code

3. **Select ANY 2 customers** (click checkboxes)

4. **Click the "Send 2 SMS" button**

5. **Click "Confirm"** in the popup

### What You Should See:

✅ **Success alert:** "2 SMS messages sent successfully!"

## 📊 Step 4: Verify It Worked (30 seconds)

Go back to **Render Dashboard** → Click **"Logs"** tab

**Scroll to the bottom** and look for:

```
[sms:headers] origin= https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app
[sms:content-type] application/json
[sms:manual-parse] Body is empty, attempting manual stream read...
[sms:manual-parse] Read 245 bytes from stream
[sms:manual-parse] ✅ Successfully parsed manual body
[sms:body] keys= to,body,companyId,accountSid,authToken,from
[sms:twilio] Sending to: +91XXXXXXXXXX
[sms:success] Message sent: SM...
```

**If you see this, IT WORKED!** 🎉

**If you still see this, Render didn't deploy yet:**

```
[sms:body] keys= undefined raw= undefined
```

_(Wait another minute and check logs again)_

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Only If Needed)

### Problem: SMS still shows undefined in logs

**Solution:**

1. Verify Render deployment finished (shows "Live")
2. Check deployment timestamp (must be AFTER your fixes)
3. Wait 60 seconds (Render cache)
4. Hard refresh dashboard: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
5. Try SMS again

### Problem: 400 error in browser console

**Solution:**

1. Render didn't deploy yet - wait longer
2. Hard refresh browser (clear cache)
3. Check Render logs for manual-parse messages
4. If still broken, trigger deploy again

### Problem: Can't find "Manual Deploy" button

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you're logged into Render
2. Click on your service name first
3. Button is in top right corner
4. Try regular "Deploy" button if manual not found

### Problem: Deploy takes too long

**Solution:**

1. Normal: 1-2 minutes
2. Long: 3-5 minutes (rare)
3. Check Render status page if stuck >5 minutes
4. Can click "Cancel" and try again
