## üåê Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (Frontend)

### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:

1. Push your code to GitHub (Step 1 above)
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Find your project: `vercel-swart-chi-29`
4. Wait for automatic deployment to complete
5. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Option B: Manual Deployment via CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. Add these variables:

```
VITE_API_BASE=https://server-cibp.onrender.com
```

**Important**: Vercel only uses `VITE_` prefixed variables for build-time environment variables.

3. Redeploy after adding variables:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." menu on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Step 3: Deploy Backend to Render

### If Backend is on Render:

1. **Push to GitHub first** (Step 1)

2. **Go to Render Dashboard**

   - Navigate to your service (e.g., `server-cibp`)

3. **Update Environment Variables**

   Add/Update these in Render Environment Variables:

   ```
   DODO_API_KEY=your_actual_dodo_api_key_here
   DODO_API_BASE=https://test.dodopayments.com
   DODO_PRODUCT_STARTER_1M=pdt_0SaMzoGEsjSCi8t0xd5vN
   DODO_PRODUCT_GROWTH_3M=pdt_OsKdNhpmFjOxSkqpwBtXR
   DODO_PRODUCT_PRO_6M=pdt_Blsof767CZTPWreD75zFF
   FRONTEND_URL=https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Trigger Manual Deploy**

   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
   - Or use "Clear build cache & deploy"

5. **Monitor Deployment Logs**
   - Look for successful startup messages
   - Check for "[Dodo] ‚úÖ" messages
   - Verify no errors

### If Backend is Elsewhere:

- Deploy to your hosting platform
- Ensure environment variables are set
- Install dependencies during deployment
- Restart the service

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Frontend Deployment

- [ ] Visit `https://vercel-swart-chi-29.vercel.app`
- [ ] Navigate to `/payment` page
- [ ] Verify all plans are displayed
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

### 2. Check Backend Deployment

- [ ] Visit `https://server-cibp.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`
- [ ] Check backend logs for Dodo configuration messages

### 3. Test Payment Flow

- [ ] Log in to your app
- [ ] Navigate to Payment page
- [ ] Select a plan
- [ ] Click "Pay" button
- [ ] Should redirect to Dodo payment page
- [ ] Complete test payment
- [ ] Should redirect back to success page

### 4. Check Server Logs

Look for these messages in production logs:

```
‚úÖ API Key loaded successfully
[Dodo Payment] Creating SUBSCRIPTION for [plan] plan...
[Dodo Payment] ‚úÖ Subscription created successfully!
[Dodo Payment] Payment URL: https://test.dodopayments.com/checkout/...
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Vercel Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Build fails
**Solution**:

```bash
# Check build logs in Vercel Dashboard
# Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
npm install
npm run build  # Test locally first
```

**Issue**: Environment variables not working
**Solution**:

- Ensure variables start with `VITE_` for frontend
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check deployment logs

### Render Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Server won't start
**Solution**:

```bash
# Check logs in Render Dashboard
# Verify all environment variables are set
# Check for missing dependencies
```

**Issue**: Dodo API calls failing
**Solution**:

- Verify `DODO_API_KEY` is set in Render
- Check it's the correct key (not wrapped in quotes)
- Ensure axios is installed (`npm install`)

### Payment Integration Issues

**Issue**: "DODO_API_KEY not configured"
**Solution**:

- Add `DODO_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
- Restart the service
- Check logs for confirmation

**Issue**: "Invalid plan selected"
**Solution**:

- Verify frontend sends: `starter_1m`, `growth_3m`, or `pro_6m`
- Check product IDs in environment variables
- Ensure they match Dodo Dashboard
