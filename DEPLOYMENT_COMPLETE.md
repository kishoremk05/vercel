# 🎉 Deployment Complete - All Issues Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend API Routing (404 Errors)

**Problem:** Frontend was calling `/api/...` routes on Vercel domain, which don't exist.

**Solution:** All API calls now use the correct backend URL:

- ✅ App.tsx - Dashboard stats endpoint
- ✅ Sidebar.tsx - Update business name endpoint
- ✅ SettingsPage.tsx - Save links endpoint
- ✅ CredentialsPage.tsx - Save credentials endpoint
- ✅ ProfilePage.tsx - Update profile endpoint

### 2. Backend Validation (500 Errors)

**Problem:** Backend was trying to read `companyId` from undefined request body.

**Solution:** Backend already had proper validation. Frontend now sends correct data format.

### 3. Firestore Permissions

**Problem:** Permission-denied errors when updating profile.

**Solution:** Rules are correct. Warnings are non-fatal and handled properly.
