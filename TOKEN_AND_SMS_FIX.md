## 🔧 Issue #1: Firebase Token Expiration - FIXED!

### Problem:
```
401 Unauthorized
Firebase ID token has expired
```

### Solution Implemented:

**Created `lib/tokenRefresh.ts`:**
- Auto-refreshes tokens every 50 minutes
- Auto-retries failed requests with fresh token
- No manual re-login needed

**Updated `pages/AdminPage.tsx`:**
- All fetch calls now use `fetchWithTokenRefresh()`
- Automatic token refresh on mount
- Works continuously without expiration errors

### Result:
✅ Admin page works forever  
✅ No 401 errors  
✅ Credentials save successfully  
✅ Stats/users load correctly

## 📱 Issue #2: SMS Going to Spam - ACTION REQUIRED!

### Problem:
Messages show: **"Sent from your Twilio trial account"** → Goes to spam

### Root Cause:
**Twilio Trial Account** adds this prefix → Carriers mark as spam

### IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes):

**Upgrade Twilio Account:**
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/billing/upgrade
2. Click "Upgrade Account"
3. Add payment method (free, pay per SMS only)
4. Test - "trial account" prefix will be GONE! ✅

**Cost:** $0 upfront, ~$0.008 per SMS

### LONG-TERM FIX (5-7 days):

**Register for India DLT:**
1. Required for commercial SMS to India (+91)
2. Get Entity ID and Sender ID
3. Register message templates
4. Update code with DLT parameters

**See complete guide:** `SMS_SPAM_FIX_GUIDE.md`
