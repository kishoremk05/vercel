# 🔥 URGENT: Fix Firebase Permission Error

## The Error You're Seeing

```
FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

This happens because your Firestore security rules don't allow regular users to read the `admin_settings/global` configuration.

---

## ✅ QUICK FIX (Choose One)

### Option 1: Deploy Rules via PowerShell Script (Fastest)

```powershell
# Run this command in PowerShell from project root:
.\deploy-firestore-rules.ps1
```

### Option 2: Deploy Rules via Command Line

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
firebase login

# Deploy the updated rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix via Firebase Console (If CLI Fails)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: **feedback-saas-55009**
3. Click **Firestore Database** in left sidebar
4. Click **Rules** tab at the top
5. Find this section:

```javascript
match /admin_settings/{settingId} {
  allow read, write: if isAdmin();
}
```

6. Replace it with:

```javascript
match /admin_settings/global {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();  // ✅ Allow authenticated users
  allow write: if isAdmin();         // ✅ Only admins can write
}

match /admin_settings/{settingId} {
  allow read, write: if isAdmin();
}
```

7. Click **Publish** button

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

After deploying rules:

1. **Clear browser cache** (or open incognito window)
2. **Reload your app**: http://localhost:5173
3. **Sign in** with your account
4. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Should see: `✅ Global config loaded from Firebase:`
   - Should NOT see: `❌ Error fetching global config`

---

## 🎯 Why This Happened

### Before (Too Strict):

```javascript
match /admin_settings/{settingId} {
  allow read, write: if isAdmin();  // ❌ Only admins can read
}
```

- Regular users couldn't read global config
- App couldn't load SMS server URL
- Permission error thrown

### After (Production-Ready):

```javascript
match /admin_settings/global {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();  // ✅ Any logged-in user can read
  allow write: if isAdmin();         // ✅ Only admins can modify
}
```

- Authenticated users can read public config (API URLs)
- Only admins can modify settings
- Secure and functional

---

## 📋 What the Rules Now Allow

| User Type          | Read Config | Write Config |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Unauthenticated    | ❌ No       | ❌ No        |
| Authenticated User | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No        |
| Admin              | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes       |

This is **secure** because:

- Unauthenticated users can't access config
- Regular users can only read (needed for app to work)
- Only admins can modify settings
- Sensitive data (Twilio tokens) should be in backend env vars, not Firestore

---

## 🚨 Still Not Working?

### Error: "Firebase CLI not found"

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login
firebase login

# Try again
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Error: "Not logged in"

```bash
firebase login --reauth
```

### Error: "Permission denied" (your Firebase account)

- You need to be an Owner or Editor of the Firebase project
- Ask the project owner to grant you access in Firebase Console

### Still seeing permission error after deploying rules

1. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear all site data**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Application tab → Clear storage → Clear site data
3. **Sign out and sign back in**
4. **Check Firestore rules are actually published**:
   - Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab
   - Verify the changes are there
