   ```

## 🐛 If SMS Still Fails After Deploy

   - Deployment time is AFTER now
   - Logs show startup messages

2. **Hard refresh browser:**

   - `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Clear all cache
   - Reload dashboard

3. **Check Render logs:**

   - Must show `[sms:manual-parse]` messages
   - Body should NOT be undefined
   - Should show `[sms:success]`

   - Should be no 400 errors
