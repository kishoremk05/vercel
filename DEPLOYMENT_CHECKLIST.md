2. [ ] Navigate to Firestore Database
3. [ ] Go to: `clients/{your-test-clientId}/profile/main`
4. [ ] Verify these fields exist:

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (First 5 minutes)

- [ ] Website loads without errors
- [ ] Login works correctly
- [ ] Payment page displays plans
- [ ] Can navigate to Profile page
- [ ] No console errors on any page

### Payment Flow Test (10 minutes)

- [ ] Complete a real payment (or use test mode)
- [ ] Verify redirect to success page
- [ ] Check Firebase Console for saved data
- [ ] Profile page shows payment details
- [ ] Test in different browser - data syncs

### Monitor (24 hours)

- [ ] Check Firebase usage/quota
- [ ] Monitor error logs in Firebase Console
- [ ] Check for user reports/issues
- [ ] Verify all payments are being recorded

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If issues occur:

1. **Revert code changes:**

   ```powershell
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or restore previous files:**

   - Restore `PaymentSuccessPage.tsx` from git history
   - Restore `ProfilePage.tsx` from git history
   - Redeploy

3. **Temporary fix:**
   - Users can still see data from localStorage
   - Manual Firebase entries can be added via Console

---

## Success Metrics

### After 1 week, verify:

- [ ] 100% of payments saved to Firebase
- [ ] 0% "No subscription data" errors (cross-browser)
- [ ] Profile page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] No Firebase quota exceeded errors
- [ ] User satisfaction with payment UI

---

## Firestore Security Rules

### Ensure these rules are active:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own profile
    match /clients/{clientId}/profile/main {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
                      (request.auth.uid == resource.data.auth_uid ||
                       request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.auth_uid);
    }

    // Allow read access to dashboard for authenticated users
    match /clients/{clientId}/dashboard/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Deploy rules:

```powershell
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
