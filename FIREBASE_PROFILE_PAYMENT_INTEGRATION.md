# Firebase Profile Payment Integration - Complete Guide

## Overview

This document explains the complete implementation of storing payment/subscription data in Firebase Firestore profile document and displaying it across all browsers and devices.

---

## üîÑ What Changed

### 1. **Payment Success Flow** (`PaymentSuccessPage.tsx`)

**Previous Behavior:**

- Saved subscription data to `clients/{clientId}/subscription/active`
- Data was not always visible across browsers

**New Behavior:**

- Saves subscription data directly to `clients/{clientId}/profile/main`
- This is the same document that already stores user profile info (name, email, etc.)
- All payment/plan fields are now part of the user's main profile

**New Fields Added to Profile:**

```typescript
{
  // Existing profile fields
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "User Name",
  auth_uid: "...",
  created_at: Timestamp,

  // NEW: Payment/Subscription fields
  planId: "growth_3m",           // Plan identifier
  planName: "Growth Plan",        // Display name
  smsCredits: 900,               // Total SMS credits
  remainingCredits: 900,         // Credits left
  status: "active",              // Subscription status
  price: 75,                     // Amount paid
  activatedAt: Timestamp,        // When subscription started
  expiryAt: Timestamp,           // When subscription expires
  savedAt: Timestamp,            // When this data was saved
  userId: "firebase_uid",        // Firebase Auth UID
  userEmail: "user@example.com"  // User email
}
```

### 2. **Profile Page Display** (`ProfilePage.tsx`)

**Previous Behavior:**

- Tried to fetch from `clients/{clientId}/subscription/active`
- Fell back to localStorage if Firebase failed
- Data was browser-specific

**New Behavior:**

- Fetches subscription data from `clients/{clientId}/profile/main`
- Displays all payment details in a clean, organized UI
- Works across all browsers and devices (data stored in Firestore)

**UI Sections Added:**

1. **Current Plan & Price** - Shows plan name and amount paid
2. **Status** - Active/Inactive status badge
3. **Start Date** - When subscription was activated
4. **Expiry Date** - When subscription will expire
5. **SMS Credits** - Usage bar showing credits used/remaining

## üîê Security Notes

### Firestore Rules (firestore.rules)

Make sure your Firestore security rules allow authenticated users to read/write their own profile:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow users to read/write their own client profile
    match /clients/{clientId}/profile/main {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
                           request.auth.uid == resource.data.auth_uid;
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Complete payment on one browser (e.g., Chrome)
- [ ] Verify payment details show on Profile page
- [ ] Open same account in different browser (e.g., Edge)
- [ ] Verify payment details are visible
- [ ] Check that SMS credits display correctly
- [ ] Verify start date and expiry date are accurate
- [ ] Check that plan name and price match payment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No subscription data available" on Profile page

**Possible Causes:**

1. Payment was not completed successfully
2. Firebase write failed (check console logs)
3. Firestore rules blocking read/write
4. User not authenticated

**Solutions:**

1. Check browser console for Firebase errors
2. Verify `companyId` exists in localStorage
3. Check Firebase console for the document at `clients/{clientId}/profile/main`
4. Verify Firestore security rules allow access

### Issue: Payment completed but data not showing

**Solutions:**

1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check if `hasPaid` is set to `"true"` in localStorage
3. Look for Firebase errors in console
4. Verify the profile document exists in Firebase console
